# Quasi-static control of quadruped robot
　　This is a demo of the quasi-static controller for the centroid of the quadruped robot. The Quadratic Programming with constricts is utilized to distribute the end force of the contact foot, and the quadruped robot can achieve continuously static walking. The algorithm is verified in the Webots simulation.  
　　This demo is cropped, so there are some redundancy and clutter, just for reference.
